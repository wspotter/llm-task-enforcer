# 🧑‍⚖️ SuperManUS Human Validation Guide
## LLM Task Completion Review System

### 🎯 **Purpose**
This guide helps humans efficiently validate LLM task completions while preventing false claims and ensuring quality.

---

## 🚨 **When Human Review is Required**

### **Automatic Approval** ✅
- **Low Risk Tasks:** Documentation, simple file operations, basic testing
- **Complete Proof Provided:** All validation commands pass, comprehensive evidence
- **Standard Changes:** Following established patterns, no architectural changes

### **Human Review Required** ⏳
- **Medium Risk Tasks:** Code implementations, configuration changes, service modifications  
- **High Risk Tasks:** Architecture changes, security implementations, deployment configs
- **Incomplete Proof:** Missing evidence, failed validations, unclear results

### **Immediate Rejection** ❌
- **No Proof:** "Should work" without evidence
- **Failed Validation:** Tests fail, syntax errors, broken functionality
- **Off-Task Work:** Work doesn't match assigned task

---

## 📋 **Validation Checklist**

### **1. Task Alignment Check**
```bash
# Verify work matches assigned task
- [ ] Work clearly advances the stated task objective
- [ ] No scope creep or unrelated changes  
- [ ] Deliverables match task requirements
```

### **2. Technical Validation**
```bash
# Run provided proof commands
- [ ] All validation commands execute successfully
- [ ] Files exist as claimed: ls -la [claimed_files]
- [ ] Code compiles: python -m py_compile *.py
- [ ] Tests pass: python -m pytest -v
- [ ] Services respond: curl -f http://service:port/health
```

### **3. Quality Assessment**
```bash
# Check work quality
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Documentation is accurate and complete
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Integration with existing system works
- [ ] No breaking changes without justification
```

### **4. Completeness Review**
```bash
# Ensure nothing is missing
- [ ] All task requirements addressed
- [ ] Work log properly documented
- [ ] Context markers added per SuperManUS standards
- [ ] Session state updated accurately
```

## ⚡ **Quick Validation Commands**

### **Instant Health Check**
```bash
# Run in project root - should all pass
git status --porcelain                                    # Show changes
find . -name "*.py" -exec python -m py_compile {} \;     # Syntax check
python test_real_functionality.py                         # Core functionality
docker-compose config --quiet                             # Docker validation
```

### **Service Testing**
```bash
# If services involved
source test_env/bin/activate
cd src && timeout 5 python main.py                       # App starts
docker-compose up -d redis postgres                      # Start dependencies
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health                     # Service health
```

### **File Integrity Check**  
```bash
# Verify claimed file changes
ls -la [files_mentioned_in_work_log]
wc -l [files_mentioned_in_work_log]
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only                              # Changed files
```

## 🎯 **Decision Matrix**

### **APPROVE** ✅
- All validation commands pass
- Work clearly advances task objective  
- Quality meets project standards
- Complete proof provided
- **Action:** Mark task complete, update session state

### **REQUEST REVISION** 🔄
- Minor issues found
- Missing documentation
- Incomplete proof
- **Action:** Provide specific feedback, require fixes

### **REJECT** ❌  
- Major functionality broken
- Work doesn't match task
- Security concerns
- False claims detected
- **Action:** Reset task status, require restart with proper approach

---

## 🚨 **Red Flags - Immediate Rejection**

### **LLM Behavior Warning Signs**
- ❌ Claims "should work" without proof
- ❌ Marks complete without running validation commands
- ❌ Creates new tasks without completing current ones
- ❌ Provides generic "successful" messages without specifics
- ❌ Skips the work log template requirements
- ❌ Makes changes unrelated to assigned task

### **Technical Warning Signs**
- ❌ Tests failing but claiming success
- ❌ Files missing that are claimed to exist
- ❌ Syntax errors in committed code
- ❌ Services not responding after "completion"
- ❌ Breaking changes without explanation
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities introduced

## 📊 **Validation Templates**

### **Simple Approval Template**
```
✅ TASK APPROVED: [Task ID]

Validation Results:
- Technical: All commands pass
- Quality: Meets standards  
- Completeness: All requirements met
- Risk Assessment: [Low/Medium] - Auto-approved

Next Action: Task marked complete, LLM may proceed to next task.
```

### **Revision Request Template**  
```
🔄 REVISION REQUIRED: [Task ID]

Issues Found:
1. [Specific issue with validation command]
2. [Missing requirement or documentation]
3. [Quality concern with explanation]

Required Actions:
- Fix [specific items]
- Provide [missing evidence]
- Re-run [validation commands]

Resubmit with complete proof package.
```

### **Rejection Template**
```
❌ TASK REJECTED: [Task ID]

Critical Issues:
- [Major problem description]
- [Impact on system/security]
- [Validation failures]

Required Actions:
1. Revert all changes
2. Restart task with proper approach  
3. Follow work log template completely
4. Provide comprehensive proof before claiming completion

Task status reset to pending.
```

## ⏱️ **Time-Saving Tips**

### **Quick Win Checks** (30 seconds)
1. Run `python test_real_functionality.py` - if this passes, core is likely intact
2. Check `git status` - see exactly what changed
3. Look for work log file in `work_logs/` directory

### **Spot Check Strategy** (2-3 minutes)
1. Pick 1-2 validation commands from the proof package
2. Verify 1-2 claimed files actually exist and contain expected content
3. Check if main functionality still works

### **Deep Validation** (5-10 minutes) - For High Risk Only
1. Run full test suite
2. Check security implications
3. Verify integration with existing system
4. Review all code changes for quality

---

## 🔧 **Human Override Commands**

### **Force Approve** (Use with caution)
```bash
# For emergencies or when you've validated manually
echo "HUMAN_OVERRIDE: Approved by [name] at $(date)" >> work_logs/current_task.md
```

### **Force Reject and Reset**
```bash
# Reset task to pending status
# Update SESSION_STATE.json to move task back to active_tasks
```

### **Delegate to Auto-Approval**
```bash
# For trusted task types you want auto-approved in future
echo "AUTO_APPROVE_PATTERN: [task_pattern]" >> .supermanus_config
```

---

## 📞 **Escalation**

### **When to Escalate**
- Security implications unclear
- Major architectural changes
- LLM behaving erratically
- Breaking changes to critical systems

### **Escalation Process**
1. Document the concern in work log
2. Mark task as "ESCALATED" 
3. Provide detailed technical assessment
4. Recommend next steps
