# üìù TaskMaster Pro - SuperManUS Example Project

A complete example showing how to use SuperManUS task enforcement in a real web application project.

## üéØ **Project Overview**

TaskMaster Pro is a task management web application that demonstrates:
- **Multi-developer coordination** with individual task assignments
- **Task-driven development** preventing scope creep
- **AI tool integration** (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) with enforcement
- **Human validation workflow** for code reviews
- **Systematic development** from planning to deployment

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **1. Install SuperManUS**
```bash
# From SuperManUS root directory
python install_supermanus.py ./example_project
```

### **2. Select Your Task**  
```python
# Each developer selects their assigned task
from supermanus.claude_code_integration import select_task

# Developer A takes authentication task
select_task("T1.1: Implement user authentication with email/password")

# Developer B takes dashboard task  
select_task("T1.2: Create user dashboard with basic profile info")

# etc.
```

### **3. Create Work Log**
```bash
# Use the template to create work log
cp WORK_LOG_TEMPLATE.md work_logs/task_T1_1_authentication.md

# Fill in task details, success criteria, and plan
```

### **4. Start Enforced Development**
```python
# All operations now require task justification
from supermanus.claude_code_integration import enforced_read, enforced_write, enforced_bash

# Read existing code
user_model = enforced_read("src/models/User.js", 
    justification="Understanding current User model to implement authentication methods required by task T1.1")

# Implement new features  
enforced_write("src/auth/authentication.js", auth_code,
    justification="Implementing email/password authentication as specified in task T1.1")

# Run tests
enforced_bash("npm test -- auth", 
    justification="Validating authentication implementation for task T1.1 completion")
```

## üìã **Task Examples**

### **T1.1: User Authentication (Developer A)**
```python
# Work log entry shows systematic approach:

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User can register with email/password
- [ ] User can login with valid credentials  
- [ ] Passwords are properly hashed (bcrypt)
- [ ] JWT tokens issued on successful login
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Tests cover all authentication flows

## Implementation Steps
1. Install and configure passport.js and bcrypt
2. Create User model with password hashing
3. Implement registration endpoint with validation
4. Implement login endpoint with JWT generation
5. Add middleware for token verification  
6. Write comprehensive tests
7. Update API documentation

## Validation Commands
- npm test -- auth
- npm run lint src/auth/
- npm run security-audit
- curl -X POST localhost:3000/auth/register (manual test)
```

### **T2.2: Task Filtering (Developer C)**
```python
# Shows how tasks build on each other:

## Dependencies  
- T1.3 must be complete (task CRUD operations)
- T2.1 components available (UI library)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Filter tasks by status (pending, in-progress, complete)
- [ ] Filter by priority (low, medium, high)
- [ ] Search tasks by title/description
- [ ] Combine multiple filters
- [ ] URL reflects current filter state
- [ ] Filters persist across page refreshes

## Implementation focuses only on filtering - no scope creep!
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Enforcement in Action**

### **Blocked Deviation Example**
```python
# Developer tries to add unrelated feature
enforced_write("src/components/FancyAnimations.js", animation_code,
    justification="Adding cool animations")

# ‚ùå BLOCKED: Poor justification doesn't advance assigned task
# System message: "Explain how this advances your current task T1.1: authentication"

# Proper justification required:
enforced_write("src/auth/LoginForm.js", login_form_code,
    justification="Creating login form component required by task T1.1 authentication implementation")
# ‚úÖ APPROVED: Clearly advances the assigned task
```

### **Completion Validation Example**
```python
# Developer claims task completion
proof_package = {
    "file_evidence": "ls -la src/auth/ && wc -l src/auth/*.js",
    "functional_test": "npm test -- auth --verbose",
    "integration_test": "npm run test:integration -- auth-flow", 
    "security_check": "npm audit && npm run security-scan src/auth/",
    "code_quality": "npm run lint src/auth/ && npm run type-check",
    "api_documentation": "Generated docs/auth-api.md with all endpoints"
}

# System validates each requirement automatically
# Human reviewer uses HUMAN_VALIDATION_GUIDE.md for final approval
```

## üë• **Multi-Developer Coordination**

### **Team Workflow**
```python
# Each developer works in isolation but contributes to shared goals

# Developer A (Authentication)
select_task("T1.1: Implement user authentication with email/password")
# Blocked from working on dashboard, task management, etc.

# Developer B (Dashboard) 
select_task("T1.2: Create user dashboard with basic profile info")
# Blocked from authentication work, can't start until T1.1 provides user session

# Developer C (Search/Filter)
select_task("T2.2: Implement task filtering and search functionality") 
# Blocked from starting until T1.3 (CRUD operations) is complete

# System prevents:
# - Duplicate work on same features
# - Dependencies being ignored
# - Scope creep across task boundaries
```

### **Integration Points**
```python
# Tasks have clear integration requirements

# T1.2 depends on T1.1
if not task_completed("T1.1"):
    raise TaskViolationException("Cannot start dashboard - authentication not ready")

# T2.2 depends on T1.3  
if not task_completed("T1.3"):
    raise TaskViolationException("Cannot implement filtering - CRUD operations not available")

# System enforces proper development sequence
```

## üîß **AI Tool Integration**

### **Cursor IDE Setup**
```bash
# Automatically configured with task context
cat .cursorrules.json
{
  "active_task": "T1.1: Implement user authentication with email/password",
  "constraints": "All suggestions must advance authentication implementation",
  "forbidden": ["unrelated UI improvements", "performance optimizations", "code refactoring"]
}
```

### **GitHub Copilot Setup**  
```bash
# Context injected into source files
cat src/auth/authentication.js

/* 
 * SuperManUS Active Task: T1.1: Implement user authentication with email/password
 * COPILOT CONSTRAINTS: Only suggest authentication-related code
 * COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS: JWT tokens, password hashing, input validation
 */

const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
// Copilot now suggests authentication-specific code...
```

### **Claude Code Integration**
```python
# All operations validated against current task
from supermanus.claude_code_integration import enforced_read, enforced_write

# This works - advances authentication task
enforced_write("src/middleware/authMiddleware.js", middleware_code,
    justification="Creating JWT verification middleware for task T1.1 authentication system")

# This is blocked - doesn't advance current task  
enforced_write("src/utils/colorUtils.js", color_code,
    justification="Adding color utilities")
# ‚ùå Error: Justification doesn't explain connection to authentication task
```

## üìä **Progress Tracking**

### **Task Completion Dashboard**
```python
# Automatically generated from SESSION_STATE.json

COMPLETED ‚úÖ: 5 tasks (31%)
- SETUP.1: Project structure ‚úÖ
- SETUP.2: Development environment ‚úÖ
